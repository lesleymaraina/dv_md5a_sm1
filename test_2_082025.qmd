## <span style="font-size:80%">Overview</span> {.smaller}

- Discuss the role of exploratory data analysis (EDA) in biomedical research

- Common sources of structure and error in biomedical data

- Data quality considerations relevant to biomedical research

## <span style="font-size:80%">Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</span> {.smaller}

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the phase of analysis in which scientists interactively explore data to uncover structure, patterns, anomalies, relationships, and generate hypotheses before formal modeling or testing

- EDA informs decisions about variable inclusion, transformation, stratification, and modeling strategy


::: footer

## <span style="font-size:80%">Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</span> {.smaller}

EDA answers questions such as:

- What values does this variable actually take?
- How were values generated?
- Are observed patterns biological, procedural, or erroneous?
- Which parts of the data are usable for a given analysis?

## <span style="font-size:80%">Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</span> {.smaller}

Scientists use data visualization in EDA to:

- Reveal structure and patterns invisible to simple statistics
- Detect anomalies and support hypothesis generation
- Guide subsequent modeling and confirmatory analysis
- Understand relationships, group effects, and high-dimensional structure

## <span style="font-size:80%">EDA Process</span> {.smaller}

- Identify anomalies (outliers, missing data)
- Transform variables (logs, standardization) and re-plot
- Hypothesis formation based on patterns
- Feature selection/engineering guided by visual insights

## <span style="font-size:80%">Data Visualization Goals in Exploratory Data Analysis</span> {.smaller}

Data visualizations in EDA are chosen based on the type of insight sought:

- **distribution** — identify skewness, multi-modality, and outliers
- **correlation/Association** — detect relationships, linearity, and clusters
- **comparison across groups** — compare distributions or summary measures
- **structure in high dimensions** — find latent clusters or separations
- **temporal patterns** — detect trends and seasonality (via line plots/heatmaps)

## <span style="font-size:80%">Data Quality</span> {.smaller}

- the concept of data quality emerged in the 1950s in manufacturing and later expanded to service domains, including healthcare$^{1}$
- despite widespread use, no universally accepted definition of data quality exists,definitions are context-dependent

## <span style="font-size:80%">Data Quality - Common Sources of Error in data</span> {.smaller}

- Biomedical datasets are shaped by clinical workflows, laboratory protocols, reimbursement systems, and institutional practices. Observed values reflect both biological processes and operational constraints. As a result, distributions often contain implausible values, structural zeros, truncation, or site-specific patterns
- visualization enables rapid identification of unexpected structure and inconsistencies in high-volume datasets
- EDA is the process of determining how biomedical data behave before deciding how to analyze the data

::: footer

## <span style="font-size:80%">Common sources of error in biomedical data</span> {.smaller}

- biomedical data quality assessment concentrates on missing and obviously implausible values
- other classes of errors—misclassification, inconsistency, duplication, and temporal misalignment are less common but have a significant impact on downstream analysis

Common Sources of Error within datasets:

- **completeness**: 
  - missing values at the variable, record, or cohort level
  - values are often easy to quantify with histograms and barcharts
- **plausibility**:
  - values that are present but biologically or logically impossible
  - data entry errors (i.e.: impossible ages)

Common Sources of Error within datasets:

- **conformance**: 
  - non-adherence to standards or expected formats
  - e.x.: invalid ICD codes
- **accuracy**:
  - values that do not reflect the true underlying state
  - e.x.: incorrect lab results - may require external ground truth

## <span style="font-size:80%">Data Quality</span> {.smaller}

- Data quality has been described as:
  - ability of an information system to accurately represent real-world states (Wand, 1996) $^{2}$
  - extent to which data has sufficient depth, breadth, and scope to support intended tasks (Wang, 1996) $^{3}$
- Wang’s framework organizes data quality into four dimensions:
  - intrinsic, contextual, representational, and accessibility
- Dimensions determine whether healthcare data is fit for its intended use

::: footer

## <span style="font-size:80%">Key Dimensions of Data Quality</span> {.smaller}

- **intrinsic quality**: correctness of the data; can we believe the data? (i.e.:  negative lab values, impossible vitals)
- **contextual quality**: whether data are appropriate for a specific task or analytic goal;fitness-for-use

  - data may be accurate yet inadequate if they are incomplete, outdated, or insufficiently granular for the intended use



::: footer

:::

## <span style="font-size:80%">Key Dimensions of Data Quality</span> {.smaller}


- **representational quality**:  how data are structured, formatted, and described

  - data are consistently encoded, clearly labeled, and interpretable by both humans and machines
  - plots help check for artifacts like: ambiguous variable names, inconsistent units, or unclear coding

- **accessibility quality**: whether data can be obtained and used when needed by authorized users

## <span style="font-size:80%">Summary</span> {.smaller}

- sources of error in biomedical data
  - biomedical data are shaped by laboratory, and institutional workflows these pipelines could lead to systematic patterns of error that must be identified before formal analysis

- exploratory data analysis (EDA) is one of the primary mechanism by which scientists detect anomalies and limitations in biomedical datasets
- many classes of errors within datasets, with data completeness as being one of the most common sources of error
- data quality is assessed through visualization-driven exploration that reveals how data are structured and informs how this might impact downstream biological conclusions
